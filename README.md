# javascript-Quiz
This is the homework assignment for unit 4 in which the goal is to create a functioning multiple-choice quiz using JavaScript

Buy utlizing a variety of function types within JavaScript, I was able to create a 5-question quiz with multiple-choice answers. 

Each question and its respective choices and answer are stored within an array as a variable. 

My start game function initiates once the Start-Button is clicked on. This function un-hides my buttons for my choices and assigns each button a choice that has been stored within an array within the questions array.

From there, there are several functions in place to activate the choice buttons and to verify the answer selected upon a choice-button click. Wrong answers deduct 10 seconds from the overall time limit and once all questions have been cycled through, the question and choice box will be cleared and instead the user's "score" will display, the score being the number of seconds remaining in the timer.
